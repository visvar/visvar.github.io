    abstract        = {Large transparent touch screens (LTTS) have recently become commercially available. These displays have the potential for engaging Augmented Reality (AR) applications, especially in public and shared spaces. However, the interaction with objects in the real environment behind the display remains challenging: Users must combine pointing and touch input if they want to select objects at varying distances. There is a lot of work on wearable or mobile AR displays, but little on how users interact with LTTS. Our goal is to contribute to a better understanding of natural user interaction for these AR displays. To this end, we developed a prototype and evaluated different pointing techniques for selecting 12 physical targets behind an LTTS, with distances ranging from 6 to 401 cm. We conducted a user study with 16 participants and measured user preferences, performance, and behavior. We analyzed the change in accuracy depending on the target position and the selection technique used. Our fndings include: (a) Users naturally align the touch point with their line of sight for targets farther than 36 cm behind the LTTS. (b) This technique provides the lowest angular deviation compared to other techniques. (c) Some user close one eye to improve their performance. Our results help to improve future AR scenarios using LTTS systems.},

We collected VC scores through a large-scale crowdsourcing experiment involving 349 participants and 1,800 visualization images. We then examined how these scores align with 12 image-based metrics spanning pixel-based and statistic-information-theoretic (clutter), color, shape, and our two new object-based metrics (meaningful-color-count (MeC) and text-to-ink ratio (TiR)). Our results show that both low-level edges and high-level elements affect perceived VC in visualization images; the number of corners and distinct colors are robust metrics across visualizations. Second, feature congestion, a statistical information-theoretic metric capturing color and texture patterns, is the strongest predictor of perceived complexity in visualizations rich in the same continuous color/texture stimuli; edge density effectively explains VC in node-link diagrams. Additionally, we observe a bell-curve effect for texts: increasing TiR initially reduces complexity, reaching an optimal point, beyond which further text increases VC. Our quantification model is also interpretable—enabling metric-based explanations—grounded in the VisComplexity2K dataset, bridging computational metrics with human perceptual responses. The preregistration is available at osf.io/5xe8a. osf.io/bdet6 has the dataset and analysis code.},

This research examines the experiences of PWD using inclusive avatars that represent disabilities. Through an exploratory mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative interviews with an experience sampling study, we develop a framework informed by Affective Events Theory and voices of PWD to better understand how social interactions in the Metaverse impact PWD’s emotions and outcomes. Findings suggest that when PWD use inclusive avatars, inclusive and exclusionary social interactions shape their emotional responses, which in turn influence engagement, avatar connection and satisfaction, and perceptions of inclusion in the Metaverse. Although adopting inclusive avatars can be challenging, especially in the face of exclusionary interactions, the benefits can outweigh the costs. The role of disability identity is critical; PWD who identify strongly with their disability experience less negative emotional impact from exclusion. This research contributes to IS literature by conceptualizing the Metaverse as a relational, emotion-driven environment shaped by social interactions as well as a platform for authentic self-representation. Practical implications include supporting avatar-based disability representation, involving PWD in co-designing virtual reality technologies, and providing training to foster inclusive interactions in the Metaverse. These strategies can help organizations build more inclusive and engaging digital workplaces for an often underrepresented workforce segment.}

Such hybrid interfaces combine both traditional and immersive displays to facilitate the exploration of 2D and 3D data representations in the environment in which they are best displayed. One key aspect is to introduce transitional animations that change between the different dimensionalities to illustrate the connection between the different representations and to reduce the potential cognitive load on the user. The specific transitions to be used depend on the type of data, the needs of the application domain, and other factors. We summarize these as a transition design space to simplify the decision-making process and provide inspiration for future designs. First, we discuss 3D visualizations from a spatial perspective: a spatial encoding pipeline, where 3D data sampled from the physical world goes through various transformations, being mapped to visual representations, and then being integrated into a hybrid AR-desktop environment. The transition design then focuses on interpolating between two spatial encoding pipelines to provide a smooth experience. To illustrate the use of our design space, we apply it to three case studies that focus on applications in astronomy, radiology, and chemistry; we then discuss lessons learned from these applications.},

    abstract        = {Exoskeletons are designed to enhance users' strength in physically demanding tasks, such as lifting and carrying heavy objects. Despite increasing physical ability, exoskeletons can introduce mechanical constraints on joint articulation, restricting certain movements. These limitations can reduce the range of motion, alter natural movement patterns, and decrease agility. This can particularly impair collaborative tasks that require movement coordination. Since industrial applications of exoskeletons also involve teamwork, it is important to find ways to support users in maintaining coordination and mitigating the side effects that are introduced with exoskeletons. To explore solutions to this problem, we developed a system that integrates AR-based motion guidance to assist users wearing exoskeletons in collaborative object-handling tasks. Our approach leverages immersive visualizations to facilitate coordination, assisting users in maintaining alignment and executing movements more smoothly. We conducted an exploratory study involving 40 participants, divided into pairs, to examine the feasibility and challenges of this approach. Our findings uncover key considerations for motion guidance evaluation in object collaborative handling tasks, the impact of the participants' pairing strategies, and technical challenges.},

To address these, we introduce a hybrid user interface (HUI) that combines a 2D desktop, a smartphone, and an AR head-mounted display (HMD) application, enabling operators to choose the most suitable device for each sub-task. The evaluation with an expert user study shows that an HUI can enhance efficiency and user experience by selecting the appropriate device for each sub-task. Generally, the HMD is preferred for tasks involving 3D content, the desktop for creating the program structure and parametrization, and the smartphone for mobile parametrization. However, the device selection depends on individual user characteristics and their familiarity with the devices.}

Parameter sensitivity analysis in this context includes estimating the sensitivity to the individual parameters, that is, to understand which parameters contribute most to changes in output classifications and for which parameter ranges these occur. We propose a novel visual parameter sensitivity analysis approach based on Voronoi cell interfaces between the sample points in the parameter space to tackle the problem. The Voronoi diagram of the sample points in the parameter space is first calculated. We then extract Voronoi cell interfaces which we use to quantify the sensitivity to parameters, considering the class label information of each sample's corresponding output. Multiple visual encodings are then utilized to represent the cell interface transitions and class label distribution, including stacked graphs for local parameter sensitivity. We evaluate the approach's expressiveness and usefulness with case studies for synthetic and real-world datasets.}

This study explores designers' preferences for three input methods - text prompts, annotations, and scribbles - through a preliminary digital paper-based study with seven professional designers. Designers preferred annotations for spatial adjustments and referencing in-image elements, while scribbles were favored for specifying attributes such as shape, size, and position, often combined with other methods. Text prompts excelled at providing detailed descriptions or when designers sought greater GenAI creativity. However, designers expressed concerns about AI misinterpreting annotations and scribbles and the effort needed to create effective text prompts.

On the one hand, touch input would make the mirror dirty. On the other hand, mid-air gestures have proven to be less accurate, slower and more error-prone. We propose the use of an AR user interface (UI): Interactive UI elements are visible “on the other side of the mirror” and can be pressed by the user’s reflection. We built a functional prototype and investigated whether this is a viable option for interacting with mirrors.

    abstract        = {Background: Proper donning and doffing of personal protection equipment (PPE) and hand hygiene in the correct spatial context of a health facility is important for the prevention and control of nosocomial infections. On-site training is difficult due to the potential infectious risks and shortages of PPE, whereas video-based training lacks immersion which is vital for the familiarization of the environment. Virtual reality (VR) training can support the repeated practice of PPE donning and doffing in an immersive environment that simulates a realistic configuration of a health facility. Objective: This study aims to develop and evaluate a VR simulation focusing on the correct event order of PPE donning and doffing, that is, the item and hand hygiene order in the donning and doffing process but not the detailed steps of how to don and doff an item, in an immersive environment that replicates the spatial zoning of a hospital. The VR method should be generic and support customizable sequencing of PPE donning and doffing. Methods: An immersive VR PPE training tool was developed by computer scientists and medical experts. The effectiveness of the immersive VR method versus video-based learning was tested in a pilot study as a randomized controlled trial (N=32: VR group, n=16; video-based training, n=16) using questionnaires on spatial-aware event order memorization questions, usability, and task workload. Trajectories of participants in the immersive environment were also recorded for behavior analysis and potential improvements of the real environment of the health facility. Results: Comparable sequence memorization scores (VR mean 79.38, SD 12.90 vs video mean 74.38, SD 17.88; P=.37) as well as National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index scores (VR mean 42.9, SD 13.01 vs video mean 51.50, SD 20.44; P=.16) were observed. The VR group had an above-average usability in the System Usability Scale (mean 74.78>70.0) and was significantly better than the video group (VR mean 74.78, SD 13.58 vs video mean 57.73, SD 21.13; P=.009). The analysis and visualization of trajectories revealed a positive correlation between the length of trajectories and the completion time, but neither correlated to the accuracy of the memorization task. Further user feedback indicated a preference for the VR method over the video-based method. Limitations of and suggestions for improvements in the study were also identified. Conclusions: A new immersive VR PPE training method was developed and evaluated against the video-based training. Results of the pilot study indicate that the VR method provides training quality comparable to video-based training and is more usable. In addition, the immersive experience of realistic settings and the flexibility of training configurations make the VR method a promising alternative to video instructions.}

However, asymmetrical setups for physical tasks that require collaboration have been little investigated. Our work implements dyadic assembly and sorting tasks supported by simultaneously using an HHD and an HMD. We conducted a user study (N=20) to evaluate this setup. Participants rated both displays’ usability similarly but showed a preference for HMD during both sorting and assembly tasks. While most participants agreed that they collaborated with their partners and the task was easier done in a team, less than half of HMD users in the sorting task agreed with the statement.}

A user study revealed that the 'zone' method reduced cognitive effort and enabled participants to understand movements more quickly, albeit with slightly lower postural accuracy compared to the 'skeleton' method. Furthermore, post-training feedback was observed to disrupt muscle memory formation during intensive sessions. Nonetheless, participants’ performance across all experimental conditions, regardless of the feedforward method or feedback mode, showed significant improvement compared to their baseline.

From a teaching perspective, it is important in such scenarios to communicate content and tasks effectively, observe whether students understand the task, and help appropriately. In our setting, students work with head-mounted displays with eye-tracking support to collaborate in a co-located space. The supervisor can observe the scene and the students and interact with them in a hybrid setup using both AR and a desktop PC. Attention monitoring and guidance are facilitated via a bidirectional mapping between 2D structural formulas and 3D molecules. We showcase our approach with an interactive teaching scenario in which chemistry students learn aspects of stereochemistry by interacting with virtual 3D models of molecular structures. An interview with supervisors and students showed that our approach has much potential in classroom applications for (1) engaging students in collaborative task solving and (2) assisting teachers in monitoring and supporting the learning processes of their students.}

    abstract        = {We live in an era in which data is abundant and growing rapidly. Big data databases sprawl past memory and computation limits and across distributed systems. To sustain this growth, engineers are designing new hardware and software systems with new storage management and capabilities for predictive computation. Yet, as datasets grow and computations become more complex, response times suffer. These infrastructures, while good for data at scale, do not support exploratory data analysis (EDA) effectively. EDA allows analysts to make sense of data with little or no known model and is essential in many application domains, from network security and fraud detection to epidemiology and preventive medicine. Data exploration is conducted with an iterative loop in which analysts interact with data through computations that return results, usually displayed with visualizations, which the analyst can then interact with again. EDA requires highly responsive system response times: at 500 ms, users typically change their querying behavior; after five or ten seconds, they abandon tasks or lose attention. To address this problem, a new computational paradigm has emerged in the last decade, which goes under several names. In the database community, it is called online aggregation, while among visualization researchers, it has been called progressive, incremental, or iterative visualization. In this book, we will refer to it as Progressive Data Analysis. This paradigm consists of splitting long computations into a series of approximate results that improve over time. In this process, partial or approximate results are rapidly returned to the user and can be interacted with in a fluent and iterative fashion. With the increasing growth in data, such progressive data analysis approaches will become one of the leading paradigms for data exploration systems, but it will also require major changes to algorithms, data structures, and visualization tools. By solving the latency issue, progressive data analysis opens up new perspectives but also presents new challenges. Problems involving complex analyses can now be addressed interactively with little or no preparation time, but how long should the analyst wait before obtaining results that are good enough to make decisions? Can progressive systems provide effective quality measures to avoid either waiting too long or deciding too early? While the progressive process is being computed, the iterative visualization of partial results should remain stable enough to be monitored. Can we stabilize these partial results without hurting their quality or speed? And, more fundamentally, can we transform all data analysis operations so that they become progressive? These questions, among others, are at the core of this book. This book is an introduction to the new paradigm of progressive data analysis and visualization. It explores the major scientific and technical benefits of performing complex data analysis progressively on big data. It also examines the challenges that must be addressed for the paradigm to become fully usable. These important issues involve research fields that are traditionally viewed as separate areas in computer science: databases, scientific computing, machine learning, visualization, statistics, and human-computer interaction; they will need to work together to achieve end to- end solutions to solve these challenges and enable the emergence of practical, progressive systems. This book closes with a research agenda to help researchers converge on key questions.}

Previous research has documented accessibility challenges, harassment, and negative experiences for PWD using disability signifiers in VR, primarily focusing on those with visible disabilities who encounter negative experiences. Yet, little is known about the experiences of people with invisible disabilities in social VR environments, and whether positive experiences are also common. To address these gaps, we designed inclusive avatars (avatars with disability signifiers) and investigated the lived experiences of 26 individuals with both visible and invisible disabilities immersing themselves in social interactions in VRChat for a week. We utilized a mixed methods experience sampling design and multilevel regression to explore the relationships between social interactions of PWD in VR and various psychological outcomes. Our results indicate that PWD, both visible and invisible, experienced positive and negative social interactions in VR. These interactions, in turn, significantly influenced users’ overall experience with inclusive avatars, affecting aspects such as emotional responses, engagement levels, satisfaction with the avatar’s design, and perceptions of inclusion in VR. Qualitative interviews of 18 participants allowed for a more nuanced exploration of the experiences of PWD by giving voice to users who are rarely studied in depth. Findings provided unique insights into both the positive and negative experiences of PWD, as well as identified key design factors influencing user experience in social VR.},

There are many types of avatars, each serving the purpose of representing users or others in these immersive spaces. However, the optimal approach for these avatars remains unclear. Although consumer applications often use cartoon-like avatars, this trend is not as common in work settings. To gain a better understanding of the kinds of avatars people prefer, three studies were conducted involving both screen-based and virtual reality setups, looking into how social settings might affect the way people choose their avatars. Personalized avatars were created for 91 participants, including 71 employees in the automotive field and 20 participants not affiliated with the company. The research shows that work-type situations influence the chosen avatar. At the same time, a correlation between the type of display medium used to display the avatar or the person’s personality and their avatar choice was not found. Based on the findings, recommendations are made for future avatar representations in work environments and implications and research questions derived that can guide future research.}

However, current haptic feedback approaches primarily focus on a single feedback type. This means users must switch between devices to experience haptic stimuli for different feedback types, such as grabbing, collision, or weight simulation. This restriction limits the ability to simulate haptics realistically for complex tasks such as maintenance. To address this issue, we evaluated existing feedback devices based on our requirements analysis to determine which devices are most suitable for simulating these three feedback types. Since no suitable haptic feedback system can simulate all three feedback types simultaneously, we evaluated which devices can be combined. Based on that, we devised a new multi-type haptic feedback system combining three haptic feedback devices. We evaluated the system with different feedback-type combinations through a qualitative expert study involving twelve automotive VR experts. The results showed that combining weight and collision feedback yielded the best and most realistic experience. The study also highlighted technical limitations in current grabbing devices. Our findings provide insights into the effectiveness of haptic device combinations and practical boundaries for automotive virtual reality tasks.}

We discuss what brushing & linking means when applied to the real world, including multiple ways of selecting referents (brushing) in augmented reality, as well as different ways of linking with an abstract data view, presented on a dedicated display (a tablet). A proof of concept was implemented to test and demonstrate the capabilities of brushing & linking of referents.

    abstract        = {Sports visualization has developed into an active research field over the last decades. Many approaches focus on analyzing movement data recorded from unstructured situations, such as soccer. For the analysis of choreographed activities like formation dancing, however, the goal differs, as dancers follow specific formations in coordinated movement trajectories. To date, little work exists on how visual analytics methods can support such choreographed performances. To fill this gap, we introduce a new visual approach for planning and assessing dance choreographies. In terms of planning choreographies, we contribute a web application with interactive authoring tools and views for the dancers' positions and orientations, movement trajectories, poses, dance floor utilization, and movement distances. For assessing dancers' real-world movement trajectories, extracted by manual bounding box annotations, we developed a timeline showing aggregated trajectory deviations and a dance floor view for detailed trajectory comparison. Our approach was developed and evaluated in collaboration with dance instructors, showing that introducing visual analytics into this domain promises improvements in training efficiency for the future.}

In motion guidance, the 'feedforward' provides instructional cues of the motions that are to be performed, whereas the 'feedback' provides cues which help correct mistakes and minimize errors. Designing synergistic feedforward and feedback is vital to providing an effective learning experience, but this interplay between the two has not yet been adequately explored. Based on a survey of the literature, we propose design space for both motion feedforward and corrective feedback in XR, and describe the interaction effects between them. We identify common design approaches of XR-based motion guidance found in our literature corpus, and discuss them through the lens of our design dimensions. We then discuss additional contextual factors and considerations that influence this design, together with future research opportunities for motion guidance in XR.},

To expand these methods, we argue that eye tracking can be used to extract further insights and quantify behavior. To this end, we contribute a study that uses eye tracking to investigate participant strategies for solving collaborative sorting and assembly tasks. We compare participants’ visual attention during situated instructions in AR and traditional paper-based instructions as a baseline. By investigating the performance and gaze behavior of the participants, different strategies for solving the provided tasks are revealed. Our results show that with situated visualization, participants focus more on task-relevant areas and require less discussion between collaboration partners to solve the task at hand.},

This paper aims to map out the challenges and opportunities for HRC within the context of timber prefabrication by constructing a conceptual framework. The framework is based on three pillars: (1) existing HRC theories and frameworks, (2) a literature review of HRC research in robotic timber fabrication, and (3) perspectives of human labour in the timber construction industry. The relevant topics among these three areas are triangulated to construct a conceptual framework that bridges the system-, design-, and human-centred considerations.

Our model first encodes scatterplots in the parametric space of a Gaussian Mixture Model, and then uses a classifier trained on human judgment data to estimate the perceptual complexity of grouping patterns. The numbers of initial mixture components and final combined groups determine the rank of the scatterplot. ClustRank improves on existing VQM techniques by mimicking human judgments on two-Gaussian cluster patterns and gives more accuracy when ranking general cluster patterns in scatterplots. We demonstrate its benefit by analyzing kinship data for genome-wide association studies, a domain in which experts rely on the visual analysis of large sets of scatterplots.

To this end, we focus on a case study, in which nine different research groups concurrently simulated the process of injecting CO2 into the subsurface. We explore different data aggregation and interactive visualization approaches to compare and analyze these nine simulations. In terms of data aggregation, one key component is the choice of similarity metrics that define the relationship between different simulations. We test different metrics and find that using the machine-learning model “S4” (tailored to the present study) as metric provides the best visualization results. Based on that, we propose different visualization methods. For overviewing the data, we use dimensionality reduction methods that allow us to plot and compare the different simulations in a scatterplot. To show details about the spatio-temporal data of each individual simulation, we employ a space-time cube volume rendering. All views support linking and brushing interaction to allow users to select and highlight subsets of the data simultaneously across multiple views. We use the resulting interactive, multi-view visual analysis tool to explore the nine simulations and also to compare them to data from experimental setups. Our main findings include new insights into ranking of simulation results with respect to experimental data, and the development of gravity fingers in simulations.}

In this work, we leverage the richness of AR research and apply it to situated visualization. We derive design patterns which summarize common approaches of visualizing data in situ. The design patterns are based on a survey of 293 papers published in the AR and visualization communities, as well as our own expertise. We discuss design dimensions that help to describe both our patterns and previous work in the literature. This discussion is accompanied by several guidelines which explain how to apply the patterns given the constraints imposed by the real world.

    abstract        = {This paper presents guitARhero, an Augmented Reality application for interactively teaching guitar playing to beginners through responsive visualizations overlaid on the guitar neck. We support two types of visual guidance, a highlighting of the frets that need to be pressed and a 3D hand overlay, as well as two display scenarios, one using a desktop magic mirror and one using a video see-through head-mounted display. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to evaluate how well users could follow instructions presented with different guidance and display combinations and compare these to a baseline where users had to follow video instructions. Our study highlights the trade-off between the provided information and visual clarity affecting the user’s ability to interpret and follow instructions for fine-grained tasks. We show that the perceived usefulness of instruction integration into an HMD view highly depends on the hardware capabilities and instruction details.}

In this paper, we introduce a human-robot collaborative system based on Augmented Reality (AR). To assess our approach, we conducted an exploratory user study on a head-mounted display (HMD) interface for task sharing between humans and an industrial robotic platform (N=16). Instead of screen-based interfaces, HMDs allowed users to receive information in-situ, regardless of their location in the workspace and the need to use their hands to handle tools or carry out tasks. We analyzed the resulting open-ended, qualitative user feedback as well as the quantitative user experience data. From the results, we derived challenges to tackle in future implementations and questions that need to be investigated to improve AR-based HRI in fabrication scenarios. The results also suggest that some aspects of human-robot interaction, like communication and trust, are more prominent when implementing a non-dyadic scenario and dealing with larger robots. The study is intended as a prequel to future work into AR-based collaboration between multiple humans and industrial robots.},

    abstract        = {Virtual Reality (VR) has gained popularity and found applications in various fields, including the automotive industry. Over the years, VR has been used in assembly, ergonomic studies, and other automotive use cases to aid development. Engineers already benefit from using VR at different stages of development, but the current setups provide only visual, auditory, and limited vibrotactile feedback on controllers. These feedback types cannot accurately simulate forces for realistic collisions or weight simulation of virtual car components. Despite ongoing research in haptic technology, there are still limitations in creating a perfect haptic feedback system that can accurately simulate all tactile and kinesthetic stimuli without hindering movement or comfort. The automotive industry needs suitable haptic feedback devices, but most research focuses on developing new devices rather than integrating them practically. We conducted four case studies to address this challenge to bridge the gap between haptic research and practical applications in automotive VR tasks. During these studies, we collaborated closely with automotive VR engineers to understand their needs and obtain feedback on using haptic devices. Our approach involved developing new haptic feedback devices based on technique- and problem-driven approaches. We created the PropellerHand, an ungrounded hand-mounted haptic device that allows forces on the hand without hindering hand use. STRIVE and STROE were developed based on problem-driven approaches, providing string-based haptic feedback devices to simulate collisions and weight. Finally, we created a multimodal haptic feedback system by combining STRIVE, STROE, and the haptic feedback glove SenseGlove, enabling users to simultaneously experience grabbing, weight, and collision feedback. Over three years, we extensively researched and implemented haptic feedback devices in practical settings. We interviewed more than 25 VR experts from the automotive industry, observed over 45 VR use cases, and collected feedback from over 200 individuals who tested our feedback devices. Based on this information, we formulated recommendations for moving haptic research into practice.}

In den letzten Jahren hat der Automatisierungsgrad in der Vorfertigung unter der Agenda der produktbasierten Bausysteme zugenommen, die ein hohes Potenzial aufweisen, aber in Umgebungen, wo eine höhere Flexibilität erforderlich ist, nur bedingt zielführend sind. Die Realisierung ressourcensparender Entwürfe führt unweigerlich zu kleinen Losgrößen und einmalig zu produzierenden Bauelementen, die für eine effiziente Fabrikation anpassungsfähige Vorfertigungsanlagen für eine Vielzahl von Lösungen erfordern. Am Exzellenzcluster Integratives computerbasiertes Planen und Bauen für die Architektur (IntCDC) werden Methoden erforscht, welche mittels Mensch-Maschine-Kollaboration eine Steigerung von Flexibilität und Adaptivität der Vorfabrikation und Konstruktion von Bauwerken anstreben. Dazu werden neben der Durchführung von Untersuchungen zur Augmented-Reality-Technologie-unterstützten Integration und Kommunikation von Mensch und Maschine auch auf maschinellem Lernen basierende Trainingsmethoden und Vorhersagemodelle entwickelt. The current generation of planners is confronted with the task of developing new, more sustainable building systems to counteract the problems of resource scarcity, urbanization, climate change and demographic change. In this context, the question of their efficient production using renewable raw materials has become the focus of research efforts. In recent years, the degree of automation in prefabrication has increased under the agenda of product-based building systems, which have a high potential but are of limited use, where greater flexibility is required. The realization of resource-efficient designs inevitably leads to small lot sizes and one-off building elements that require adaptable prefabrication facilities for a variety of solutions for efficient fabrication. At the Cluster of Excellence Integrative Computational Design and Construction for Architecture (IntCDC) methods are being researched which aim to increase the flexibility and adaptivity of prefabrication and construction of buildings by means of human-machine collaboration. To this end, research is also being conducted on the integration and communication of humans and machines supported by augmented reality technology, as well as on training methods and prediction models based on machine learning.},

The interface offers views of the dancers' positions and orientations, pattern transitions, poses, and analytical information like dance floor utilization and movement distances.

Current evaluation procedures for AR applications rely primarily on questionnaires and interviews, providing qualitative means to assess usability and task solution strategies. Eye tracking extends these existing evaluation methodologies by providing indicators for visual attention to virtual and real elements in the environment. However, the analysis of viewing behavior, especially the comparison of multiple participants, is difficult to achieve in AR. Specifically, the definition of areas of interest (AOIs), which is often a prerequisite for such analysis, is cumbersome and tedious with existing approaches. To address this issue, we present a new visualization approach to define AOIs, label fixations, and investigate the resulting annotated scanpaths. Our approach utilizes automatic annotation of gaze on virtual objects and an image-based approach that also considers spatial context for the manual annotation of objects in the real world. Our results show, that with our approach, eye tracking data from AR scenes can be annotated and analyzed flexibly with respect to data aspects and annotation strategies.}

Our method is based on a space-time cube visualization and a linked 3D replay of recorded data. We showcase our approach with an experiment that examines how people investigate an artwork collection. The visualization provides insights into how people moved and inspected individual pictures in their spatial context over time. In contrast to existing methods, this analysis is possible for multiple participants without extensive annotation of areas of interest.

However, it remains unclear what strategies users apply in different wrapping settings. This is important for design implications for future work on more effective wrapped visualizations for network applications, and cyclic data that could benefit from wrapping. We perform visual-exploratory data analysis of gaze data, and conduct statistical tests derived from the patterns identified. Results show distinguishable gaze behaviors, with more visual glances and transitions between areas of interest in the non-replicated layout. Full-context has more successful visual searches than partial-context, but the gaze allocation indicates that the layout could be more space-efficient.},

Our study results indicated that adding an enhanced error feedback visualization helped the users with short-term retention.}

    abstract        = {As social virtual reality (VR) becomes more popular, avatars are being designed with realistic behaviors incorporating non-verbal cues like eye contact. However, perceiving eye contact during a onversation can be challenging for people with visual impairments. VR presents an opportunity to display eye contact cues in alternative ways, making them perceivable for people with visual impairments. We performed an exploratory study to gain initial insights on designing eye contact cues for people with visual impairments, including a focus group for a deeper understanding of the topic. We implemented eye contact cues via visual, auditory, and tactile sensory modalities in VR and tested these approaches with eleven participants with visual impairments and collected qualitative feedback. The results show that visual cues indicating the gaze direction were preferred, but auditory and tactile cues were also prevalent as they do not superimpose additional visual information.},

We tested this prototype in two pilot studies and found that AR does have potential in this type of application.

For instance, haptic feedback in combination with a virtual representation supports working on use cases where collision is an important part to maintain data quality. To understand the dependency of both, we conducted a pilot study with 15 users from the automotive sector to examine the influence of upper limb representations on haptic feedback in Virtual Reality. Each participant was assigned with one of three upper limb representations which was used in different scenarios using haptic feedback devices. Overall, we found that the realistic arm representation was rated highest in terms of perceived realism and achieved the best task performance.}

In an iterative process, the composer queries the AI for continuations or alternative fill-ins, chooses a suggestion, and adds it to the piece. As listening to many suggestions would take time, we explore different ways to visualize them, to allow the composer to focus on the most interesting-looking melodies. We also present the results of a qualitative evaluation with five composers.}

While this kind of control has already been possible with hardware MIDI devices, we provide a more accessible, easy-to-use, and customizable alternative that only requires a web browser. With examples, we show how users perform live-coded music faster and more easily with our design compared to using pure code.}

The resulting typology and image analysis may serve a number of purposes: to study the evolution of the community and its research output over time, to facilitate the categorization of visualization images for the purpose of teaching, to identify visual designs for evaluation purposes, or to enable progress towards standardization in visualization. In addition to the typology and image characterization, we provide a dataset of 6,833 tagged images and an online tool that can be used to explore and analyze the large set of tagged images. We thus facilitate a discussion of the diverse visualizations used and how they are published and communicated in our community.}

While many papers have addressed scalability issues, our survey identifies a lack of consistency in the use of the term in the visualization research community. We address this issue by introducing a consistent terminology meant to help visualization researchers better characterize the scalability aspects in their research. It also helps in providing multiple methods for supporting the claim that a work is 'scalable'. Our model is centered around an effort function with inputs and outputs. The inputs are the problem size and resources, whereas the outputs are the actual efforts, for instance, in terms of computational run time or visual clutter. We select representative examples to illustrate different approaches and facets of what scalability can mean in visualization literature. Finally, targeting the diverse crowd of visualization researchers without a scalability tradition, we provide a set of recommendations for how scalability can be presented in a clear and consistent way to improve fair comparison between visualization techniques and systems and foster reproducibility.}

We consider three overview tasks on networks with 500 nodes: (T1) network class identification, (T2) cluster detection, and (T3) network density estimation, and two detailed tasks: (T4) node in-degree vs. out-degree and (T5) representation mapping, on networks with 50 and 20 nodes, respectively.

Recent studies are showing that people often use dimensionality reduction as a black-box regardless of the specific properties the method itself preserves. Hence, evaluating and comparing 2D embeddings is usually qualitatively decided, by setting embeddings side-by-side and letting human judgment decide which embedding is the best. In this work, we propose a quantitative way of evaluating embeddings, that nonetheless places human perception at the center. We run a comparative study, where we ask people to select “good” and “misleading” views between scatterplots of low-dimensional embeddings of image datasets, simulating the way people usually select embeddings. We use the study data as labels for a set of quality metrics for a supervised machine learning model whose purpose is to discover and quantify what exactly people are looking for when deciding between embeddings. With the model as a proxy for human judgments, we use it to rank embeddings on new datasets, explain why they are relevant, and quantify the degree of subjectivity when people select preferred embeddings.}

We give an overview on the concepts, topics, research questions, and challenges.}

In the other direction, we discuss approaches showing how ML helps improve VIS, such as applying ML-based automation to improve visualization design.

To provide better support for that, we define requirements for text input methods that target situated visualization authoring. We identify wearable chorded keyboards as a potentially suitable method that fulfills some of these requirements. To further investigate this approach, we tailored a chorded keyboard device to visualization authoring, developed a learning application, and conducted a pilot user study. Our results confirm that learning a high number of chords is the main barrier for adoption, as in other application areas. Based on that, we discuss ideas on how chorded keyboards with a strongly reduced alphabet, hand gestures, and voice recognition might be used as a viable, multi-modal support for authoring situated visualizations in-situ.},

    abstract        = {A common enhancement of scatterplots represents points as small multiples, glyphs, or thumbnail images. As this encoding often results in overlaps, a general strategy is to alter the position of the data points, for instance, to a grid-like structure. Previous approaches rely on solving expensive optimization problems or on dividing the space that alter the global structure of the scatterplot. To find a good balance between efficiency and neighborhood and layout preservation, we propose HAGRID, a technique that uses space-filling curves (SFCs) to “gridify” a scatterplot without employing expensive collision detection and handling mechanisms. Using SFCs ensures that the points are plotted close to their original position, retaining approximately the same global structure. The resulting scatterplot is mapped onto a rectangular or hexagonal grid, using Hilbert and Gosper curves. We discuss and evaluate the theoretic runtime of our approach and quantitatively compare our approach to three state-of-the-art gridifying approaches, DGRID, Small multiples with gaps SMWG, and CorrelatedMultiples CMDS, in an evaluation comprising 339 scatterplots. Here, we compute several quality measures for neighborhood preservation together with an analysis of the actual runtimes. The main results show that, compared to the best other technique, HAGRID is faster by a factor of four, while achieving similar or even better quality of the gridified layout. Due to its computational efficiency, our approach also allows novel applications of gridifying approaches in interactive settings, such as removing local overlap upon hovering over a scatterplot.}

To fulfill this promise, sensory feedback, such as haptics, is an important component, which is however not well supported yet. Existing haptic devices are often expensive, stationary, or occupy the user’s hand, preventing them from grasping objects or using a controller. We propose PropellerHand, an ungrounded hand-mounted haptic device with two rotatable propellers, that allows exerting forces on the hand without obstructing hand use. PropellerHand is able to simulate feedback such as weight and torque by generating thrust up to 11 N in 2-DOF and a torque of 1.87 Nm in 2-DOF. Its design builds on our experience from quantitative and qualitative experiments with different form factors and parts. We evaluated our prototype through a qualitative user study in various VR scenarios that required participants to manipulate virtual objects in different ways, while changing between torques and directional forces. Results show that PropellerHand improves users’ immersion in virtual reality. Additionally, we conducted a second user study in the field of immersive visualization to investigate the potential benefits of PropellerHand there.}

To conduct a pilot study, we developed a prototypical system that displays the extracted visual parameters and then maps them on a virtual avatar while playing the corresponding audio fle. We tested the system with 5 participants in two conditions: (i) while seeing the virtual avatar only an audio fle was played. (ii) In addition to the audio fle, the extracted facial visual parameters were displayed on the virtual avatar. Our results suggest the validity of using additional visual parameters in the avatars face as it helps to determine emotions.

This metaphorical mapping is very flexible and allows us to adapt the visualization to its application and target audience. We present several examples where we map data to different domains and representations. This includes mapping data to cat images, encoding research interests with neural style transfer and representing movies as stars in the night sky.

We connect AR visualization with data streams from the Internet of Things using distributed dataflow. To this aim, we use reactive programming patterns so that visualizations become context-aware, i.e., they adapt to events coming in from the environment. The resulting authoring system is low-code; it emphasises describing the physical and the virtual world and the dataflow between the elements contained therein.

In this context, new hidden patterns such as increased eccentricities in an engine's rotor by observing secondary excitations of its bearings were detected using analyses made with RfX. Rules derived from analyses with the system led to a change in the company's testing procedures for electrical engines, which resulted in 80% reduced testing time for over 30% of all components.},

In our interview study, we explored the status quo of VR collaboration in a large automotive company setting with a special focus on the role of avatars. We collected inter-view data from 21 participants, from which we identified challenges of current avatar representations used in our setting. Based on these findings, we discuss design suggestions for avatars in a company setting, which aim to improve social interaction.

While observing the results of the intermediate optimization steps of DR algorithms, we coincidently discovered the artistic beauty of the DR process. With enthusiasm for the beauty, we decided to look at DR from a generative art lens rather than their technical application aspects and use DR techniques to create artwork. Particularly, we use the optimization process to generate images, by drawing each intermediate step of the optimization process with some opacity over the previous intermediate result. As another alternative input, we used a neural-network model for face-landmark detection, to apply DR to portraits, while maintaining some facial properties, resulting in abstracted facial avatars. In this work, we provide such a collection of such artwork.}

A crucial step of this process is to inspect the model’s accuracy and decide whether it is necessary to label additional elements. In scenarios with no or very little labeled data, visual inspection of the predictions is required. Similarity-preserving scatterplots created through a dimensionality reduction algorithm are a common visualization that is used in these cases. Previous studies investigated the effects of layout and image complexity on tasks like labeling. However, model evaluation has not been studied systematically. We present the results of an experiment studying the influence of image complexity and visual grouping of images on model accuracy estimation. We found that users outperform traditional automated approaches when estimating a model’s accuracy. Furthermore, while the complexity of images impacts the overall performance, the layout of the items in the plot has little to no effect on estimations.}

In addition to the design of STRIVE, this process led to a set of requirements for introducing haptic devices into industrial settings, which center around a need for flexibility regarding forces, comfort, and mobility. We evaluated STRIVE with 16 engineers in five different day-to-day automotive VR use cases. The main results show an increased level of trust and perceived safety as well as further challenges towards moving haptics research into practice.},

In serial manufacturing processes, signatures from acoustic data provide valuable information on how the relationship between multiple produced engines serves to detect and understand previously unknown errors. To analyze such signatures, IRVINE leverages interactive clustering and data labeling techniques, allowing users to analyze clusters of engines with similar signatures, drill down to groups of engines, and select an engine of interest. Furthermore, IRVINE allows to assign labels to engines and clusters and annotate the cause of an error in the acoustic raw measurement of an engine. Since labels and annotations represent valuable knowledge, they are conserved in a knowledge database to be available for other stakeholders. We contribute a design study, where we developed IRVINE in four main iterations with engineers from a company in the automotive sector. To validate IRVINE, we conducted a field study with six domain experts. Our results suggest a high usability and usefulness of IRVINE as part of the improvement of a real-world manufacturing process. Specifically, with IRVINE domain experts were able to label and annotate produced electrical engines more than 30% faster.}

VR environments often lack immersion due to missing sensory feedback when interacting with data. Existing haptic devices are often expensive, stationary, or occupy the user’s hand, preventing them from grasping objects or using a controller. We propose PropellerHand, an ungrounded hand-mounted haptic device with two rotatable propellers, that allows exerting forces on the hand without obstructing hand use. PropellerHand is able to simulate feedback such as weight and torque by generating thrust up to 11 N in 2-DOF and a torque of 1.87 Nm in 2-DOF. Its design builds on our experience from quantitative and qualitative experiments with different form factors and parts. We evaluated our final version through a qualitative user study in various VR scenarios that required participants to manipulate virtual objects in different ways, while changing between torques and directional forces. Results show that PropellerHand improves users’ immersion in virtual reality.}

As this encoding often results in overlaps, a general strategy is to alter the position of the data points, for instance, to a grid-like structure. Previous approaches rely on solving expensive optimization problems or on dividing the space that alter the global structure of the scatterplot. To find a good balance between efficiency and neighborhood and layout preservation, we propose Hagrid, a technique that uses space-filling curves (SFCs) to “gridify” a scatterplot without employing expensive collision detection and handling mechanisms. Using SFCs ensures that the points are plotted close to their original position, retaining approximately the same global structure. The resulting scatterplot is mapped onto a rectangular or hexagonal grid, using Hilbert and Gosper curves. We discuss and evaluate the theoretic runtime of our approach and quantitatively compare our approach to three state-of-the-art gridifying approaches, DGrid, Small multiples with gaps SMWG, and CorrelatedMultiples CMDS, in an evaluation comprising 339 scatterplots. Here, we compute several quality measures for neighborhood preservation together with an analysis of the actual runtimes. The main results show that, compared to the best other technique, Hagrid is faster by a factor of four, while achieving similar or even better quality of the gridified layout. Due to its computational efficiency, our approach also allows novel applications of gridifying approaches in interactive settings, such as removing local overlap upon hovering over a scatterplot.}

We propose a unified design space for instance selection strategies to support detailed and fine-grained analysis covering both of these perspectives. We identify a concise set of 15 properties, namely measureable characteristics of datasets or of machine learning models applied to them, that cover most of the strategies in these literatures. To quantify these properties, we introduce Property Measures (PM) as fine-grained building blocks that can be used to formalize instance selection strategies. In addition, we present a taxonomy of PMs to support the description, evaluation, and generation of PMs across four dimensions: machine learning (ML) Model Output, Instance Relations, Measure Functionality, and Measure Valence. We also create computational infrastructure to support qualitative visual data analysis: a visual analytics explainer for PMs built around an implementation of PMs using cascades of eight atomic functions. It supports eight analysis tasks, covering the analysis of datasets and ML models using visual comparison within and between PMs and groups of PMs, and over time during the interactive labeling process. We iteratively refined the PM taxonomy, the explainer, and the task abstraction in parallel with each other during a two-year formative process, and show evidence of their utility through a summative evaluation with the same infrastructure. This research builds a formal baseline for the better understanding of the commonalities and differences of instance selection strategies, which can serve as the stepping stone for the synthesis of novel strategies in future work.}

Every year, a vast amount of different techniques, applications, and user studies are published that focus on employing immersive environments for visualizing and analyzing data. Nevertheless, immersive analytics is still a relatively unexplored field that needs more basic research in many aspects and is still viewed with skepticism. Rightly so, because in our opinion, many researchers do not fully exploit the possibilities offered by immersive environments and, on the contrary, sometimes even overestimate the power of immersive visualizations. Although a growing body of papers has demonstrated individual advantages of immersive analytics for specific tasks and problems, the general benefit of using immersive environments for effective analytic tasks remains controversial. In this article, we reflect on when and how immersion may be appropriate for the analysis and present four guiding scenarios. We report on our experiences, discuss the landscape of assessment strategies, and point out the directions where we believe immersive visualizations have the greatest potential.}

    abstract        = {We present document domain randomization (DDR), the first successful transfer of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained only on graphically rendered pseudo-paper pages to real-world document segmentation. DDR renders pseudo-document pages by modeling randomized textual and non-textual contents of interest, with user-defined layout and font styles to support joint learning of fine-grained classes. We demonstrate competitive results using our DDR approach to extract nine document classes from the benchmark CS-150 and papers published in two domains, namely annual meetings of Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and IEEE Visualization (VIS). We compare DDR to conditions of style mismatch, fewer or more noisy samples that are more easily obtained in the real world. We show that high-fidelity semantic information is not necessary to label semantic classes but style mismatch between train and test can lower model accuracy. Using smaller training samples had a slightly detrimental effect. Finally, network models still achieved high test accuracy when correct labels are diluted towards confusing labels; this behavior hold across several classes.},

We address the visual analysis of class separation measures for both high-dimensional data and its corresponding projections into 2D through dimensionality reduction (DR) methods. Although a plethora of separation measures have been proposed, it is difficult to compare class separation between multiple datasets with different characteristics, multiple separation measures, and multiple DR methods. We present ProSeCo, an interactive visualization approach to support comparison between up to 20 class separation measures and up to 4 DR methods, with respect to any of 7 dataset characteristics: dataset size, dataset dimensions, class counts, class size variability, class size skewness, outlieriness, and real-world vs. synthetically generated data. ProSeCo supports (1) comparing across measures, (2) comparing high-dimensional to dimensionally-reduced 2D data across measures, (3) comparing between different DR methods across measures, (4) partitioning with respect to a dataset characteristic, (5) comparing partitions for a selected characteristic across measures, and (6) inspecting individual datasets in detail. We demonstrate the utility of ProSeCo in two usage scenarios, using datasets [1] posted at https://osf.io/epcf9/.}

In formative interviews, we found that tools allowing structuring of observations are often disconnected from the corresponding evidence. Therefore, we designed a sensemaking environment with a flexible observation graph that visually ties together evidence in unstructured documents with the user’s structured knowledge. This is achieved through bi-directional deep links between highlighted document portions and nodes in the observation graph. In a controlled study, we compared users’ sensemaking strategies using either the observation graph or a simple text editor on a large display. Results show that the observation graph represents a holistic, compact representation of users’ observations, which can be linked to unstructured evidence on demand. In contrast, users taking textual notes required much more display space to spatially organize source documents containing unstructured evidence. This implies that spatial organization is a powerful strategy to structure observations even if the available space is limited.}

    abstract        = {Movement-compensating interactions like teleportation are commonly deployed techniques in virtual reality environments. Although practical, they tend to cause disorientation while navigating. Previous studies show the effectiveness of orientation-supporting tools, such as trails, in reducing such disorientation and reveal different strengths and weaknesses of individual tools. However, to date, there is a lack of a systematic comparison of those tools when teleportation is used as a movement-compensating technique, in particular under consideration of different tasks. In this paper, we compare the effects of three orientation-supporting tools, namely minimap, trail, and heatmap. We conducted a quantitative user study with 48 participants to investigate the accuracy and efficiency when executing four exploration and search tasks. As dependent variables, task performance, completion time, space coverage, amount of revisiting, retracing time, and memorability were measured. Overall, our results indicate that orientation-supporting tools improve task completion times and revisiting behavior. The trail and heatmap tools were particularly useful for speed-focused tasks, minimal revisiting, and space coverage. The minimap increased memorability and especially supported retracing tasks. These results suggest that virtual reality systems should provide orientation aid tailored to the specific tasks of the users.}

Our goal is to provide guidance for future evaluations of MR/AR approaches. To this end, we characterize publications by paper type (e.g., technique, design study), research topic (e.g., tracking, rendering), evaluation scenario (e.g., algorithm performance, user performance), cognitive aspects (e.g., perception, emotion), and the context in which evaluations were conducted (e.g., lab vs. in-thewild). We found a strong coupling of types, topics, and scenarios. We observe two groups: (a) technology-centric performance evaluations of algorithms that focus on improving tracking, displays, reconstruction, rendering, and calibration, and (b) human-centric studies that analyze implications of applications and design, human factors on perception, usability, decision making, emotion, and attention. Amongst the 458 papers, we identified 248 user studies that involved 5,761 participants in total, of whom only 1,619 were identified as female. We identified 43 data collection methods used to analyze 10 cognitive aspects. We found nine objective methods, and eight methods that support qualitative analysis. A majority (216/248) of user studies are conducted in a laboratory setting. Often (138/248), such studies involve participants in a static way. However, we also found a fair number (30/248) of in-the-wild studies that involve participants in a mobile fashion. We consider this paper to be relevant to academia and industry alike in presenting the state-of-the-art and guiding the steps to designing, conducting, and analyzing results of evaluations in MR/AR.}

In doing so, we want to compare pre-evaluation with an approach that seeks to directly map real facial expressions onto their virtual counterparts. To evaluate both approaches, we conduct a controlled lab study with 22 participants. The results show that users are significantly more accurate in judging virtual facial expressions with pre-evaluated mapping. Additionally, participants were slightly more confident when deciding on a presented emotion. We could not find any differences regarding potential Uncanny Valley effects. However, the pre-evaluated mapping shows potential to be more convenient in a conversational scenario.}

Our results indicate that a first-person perspective performs best for all visible motions, whereas the type of visual instruction plays a minor role.

In addition, those DR methods that exist in JavaScript libraries, such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP, do not offer consistent programming interfaces, hampering the quick integration of different methods. Toward a coherent and comprehensive DR programming framework, we developed an open source JavaScript library named DruidJS. Our library contains implementations of ten different DR algorithms, as well as the required linear algebra techniques, tools, and utilities.}

During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating visualizations is a core requirement. However, performing such evaluations is intrinsically hard as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. This approach's primary assumption is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Using this study design, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that the situated visualizations we investigated in this study are not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Our study provides the first evidence that analyzing situated visualizations through different empirical (surrogate) methods might lead to comparable results.}

    abstract        = {In this paper, we propose SineStream, a new variant of streamgraphs that improves their readability by minimizing sine illusion effects. Such effects reflect the tendency of humans to take the orthogonal rather than the vertical distance between two curves as their distance. In SineStream, we connect the readability of streamgraphs with minimizing sine illusions and by doing so provide a perceptual foundation for their design. As the geometry of a streamgraph is controlled by its baseline (the bottom-most curve) and the ordering of the layers, we re-interpret baseline computation and layer ordering algorithms in terms of reducing sine illusion effects. For baseline computation, we improve previous methods by introducing a Gaussian weight to penalize layers with large thickness changes. For layer ordering, three design requirements are proposed and implemented through a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Quantitative experiments and user studies demonstrate that SineStream improves the readability and aesthetics of streamgraphs compared to state-of-the-art methods.}

While other methods separate the creation of colors from their assignment, our approach takes data characteristics into account to produce color palettes, which are then assigned in a way that fosters better visual discrimination of classes. To do so, we use a customized optimization based on simulated annealing to maximize the combination of three carefully designed color scoring functions: point distinctness, name difference, and color discrimination. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art palettes with a controlled user study for scatterplots and line charts, furthermore we performed a case study. Our results show that Palettailor, as a fully-automated approach, generates color palettes with a higher discrimination quality than existing approaches. The efficiency of our optimization allows us also to incorporate user modifications into the color selection process.}

Building upon recent findings in visualization research about the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of class separation for 2D dimensionally reduced data using scatterplots, this research addresses the visual analysis of class separation measures for high-dimensional data. We present SepEx, an interactive visualization approach for the assessment and comparison of class separation measures for multiple datasets. SepEx supports analysts with the comparison of multiple separation measures over many high-dimensional datasets, the effect of dimensionality reduction on measure outputs by supporting nD to 2D comparison, and the comparison of the effect of different dimensionality reduction methods on measure outputs. We demonstrate SepEx in a scenario on 100 two-class 5D datasets with a linearly increasing amount of separation between the classes, illustrating both similarities and nonlinearities across 11 measures.}

First, we investigate the sensitivity of scagnostics by employing perturbing operations on more than 60M synthetic and real-world scatterplots. We found that two scagnostic measures, Outlying and Clumpy, are overly sensitive to data binning. To understand how these measures align with human judgments of visual features, we conducted a study with 24 participants, which reveals that i) humans are not sensitive to small perturbations of the data that cause large changes in both measures, and ii) the perception of clumpiness heavily depends on per-cluster topologies and structures. Motivated by these results, we propose Robust Scagnostics (RScag) by combining adaptive binning with a hierarchy-based form of scagnostics. An analysis shows that RScag improves on the robustness of original scagnostics, aligns better with human judgments, and is equally fast as the traditional scagnostic measures.}

    abstract        = {Automatic clustering techniques play a central role in Visual Analytics by helping analysts to discover interesting patterns in high-dimensional data. Evaluating these clustering techniques, however, is difficult due to the lack of universal ground truth. Instead, clustering approaches are usually evaluated based on a subjective visual judgment of low-dimensional scatterplots of different datasets. As clustering is an inherent human-in-the-loop task, we propose a more systematic way of evaluating clustering algorithms based on quantification of human perception of clusters in 2D scatterplots. The core question we are asking is in how far existing clustering techniques align with clusters perceived by humans. To do so, we build on a dataset from a previous study [1], in which 34 human subjects la-beled 1000 synthetic scatterplots in terms of whether they could see one or more than one cluster. Here, we use this dataset to benchmark state-of-the-art clustering techniques in terms of how far they agree with these human judgments. More specifically, we assess 1437 variants of K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models, CLIQUE, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering techniques on these benchmarks data. We get unexpected results. For instance, CLIQUE and DBSCAN are at best in slight agreement on this basic cluster counting task, while model-agnostic Agglomerative clustering can be up to a substantial agreement with human subjects depending on the variants. We discuss how to extend this perception-based clustering benchmark approach, and how it could lead to the design of perception-based clustering techniques that would better support more trustworthy and explainable models of cluster patterns.}

These alternatives are computed based on either user interactions or model quality measures and can be explored using delta-visualizations. By automatically proposing modeling alternatives, systems employing Speculative Execution can shorten the gap between users and models, reduce the confirmation bias and speed up optimization processes. In this paper, we have assembled five application scenarios showcasing the potential of Speculative Execution, as well as a potential for further research.}

Based on the results, we form ClustMe by selecting the model that best predicts these human judgments among 7 different state-of-the-art merging techniques (Demp). To quantitatively evaluate ClustMe, we conducted a second study, in which 31 human subjects ranked 435 pairs of scatterplots of real and synthetic data in terms of cluster patterns complexity. We use this data to compare ClustMe's performance to 4 other state-of-the-art clustering measures, including the well-known Clumpiness scagnostics.

Our results show that such neighborhood effects exist: a target bar surrounded by high neighbor bars, is perceived to be lower as the same bar surrounded with low neighbors. Yet, the effect size of this neighborhood effect is small compared to other data-inherent effects: the judgment accuracy largely depends on the target bar rank, number of data items, and other data characteristics of the dataset.

Due to the vast number of available modeling algorithms, an efficient and effective comparison of their results is detrimental to a data- and task-driven selection of a model. LTMA automates this comparative analysis by providing topic matching based on two layers (document-overlap and keyword-similarity), creating a novel topic-match data structure. This data structure builds a basis for model exploration and optimization, thus, allowing for an efficient evaluation of their performance in the context of a given type of text data and task. This is especially important for text types where an annotated gold standard dataset is not readily available and, therefore, quantitative evaluation methods are not applicable. We confirm the usefulness of our technique based on three use cases, namely: (1) the automatic comparative evaluation of topic models, (2) the visual exploration of topic modeling differences, and (3) the optimization of topic modeling results through combining matches.}

In addition, we put forward a methodological discussion on how biases might be studied on all three levels, and which pitfalls and threats to validity exist.

Furthermore, the framework enables us to optimize fisheye lenses towards specific tasks and design a family of new lenses: polyfocal, cluster, and path lenses. A GPU implementation lets us process large graphs with up to 15,000 nodes at interactive rates. A comprehensive evaluation, a user study, and two case studies demonstrate that our structure-aware fisheye views improve layout readability and user performance.}

Currently, users of visualization software routinely rely on color mappings that have been pre-defined by the software. A default color mapping, however, cannot ensure an optimal perceptual separability between groups, and sometimes may even lead to a misinterpretation of the data. In this paper, we present an effective approach for color assignment based on a set of given colors that is designed to optimize the perception of scatterplots. Our approach takes into account the spatial relationships, density, degree of overlap between point clusters, and also the background color. For this purpose, we use a genetic algorithm that is able to efficiently find good color assignments. We implemented an interactive color assignment system with three extensions of the basic method that incorporates top K suggestions, user-defined color subsets, and classes of interest for the optimization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our assignment technique, we conducted a numerical study and a controlled user study to compare our approach with default color assignments; our findings were verified by two expert studies. The results show that our approach is able to support users in distinguishing cluster numbers faster and more precisely than default assignment methods.}

Visual-interactive labeling (VIAL) provides users an active role in the process of labeling, with the goal to combine the potentials of humans and machines to make labeling more efficient. Recent experiments showed that users apply different strategies when selecting instances for labeling with visual-interactive interfaces. In this paper, we contribute a systematic quantitative analysis of such user strategies. We identify computational building blocks of user strategies, formalize them, and investigate their potentials for different machine learning tasks in systematic experiments. The core insights of our experiments are as follows. First, we identified that particular user strategies can be used to considerably mitigate the bootstrap (cold start) problem in early labeling phases. Second, we observed that they have the potential to outperform existing active learning strategies in later phases. Third, we analyzed the identified core building blocks, which can serve as the basis for novel selection strategies. Overall, we observed that data-based user strategies (clusters, dense areas) work considerably well in early phases, while model-based user strategies (e.g., class separation) perform better during later phases. The insights gained from this work can be applied to develop novel active learning approaches as well as to better guide users in visual interactive labeling.},
