                <div class="abstract"><b>Abstract.</b> Immersive platforms like the Metaverse have gained attention in information systems (IS) research, yet the diverse needs of people with disabilities (PWD) remain underexplored. This research examines the experiences of PWD using inclusive avatars that represent disabilities. Through an exploratory mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative interviews with an experience sampling study, we develop a framework informed by Affective Events Theory and voices of PWD to better understand how social interactions in the Metaverse impact PWDâ€™s emotions and outcomes. Findings suggest that when PWD use inclusive avatars, inclusive and exclusionary social interactions shape their emotional responses, which in turn influence engagement, avatar connection and satisfaction, and perceptions of inclusion in the Metaverse. Although adopting inclusive avatars can be challenging, especially in the face of exclusionary interactions, the benefits can outweigh the costs. The role of disability identity is critical; PWD who identify strongly with their disability experience less negative emotional impact from exclusion. This research contributes to IS literature by conceptualizing the Metaverse as a relational, emotion-driven environment shaped by social interactions as well as a platform for authentic self-representation. Practical implications include supporting avatar-based disability representation, involving PWD in co-designing virtual reality technologies, and providing training to foster inclusive interactions in the Metaverse. These strategies can help organizations build more inclusive and engaging digital workplaces for an often underrepresented workforce segment.</div>
