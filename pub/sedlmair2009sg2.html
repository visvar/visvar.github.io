                <div class="abstract"><b>Abstract.</b> Most information visualisation methods are based on abstract visual representations without any concrete manifestation in the “real world”. However, a variety of abstract datasets can indeed be related to, and hence enriched by, real-world aspects. In these cases an additional virtual representation of the 3D object can help to gain a better insight into the connection between abstract and real-world issues. We demonstrate this approach with two prototype systems that combine information visualisation with 3D models in multiple coordinated views. The first prototype involves the visualisation of in-car communication traces. The 3D model of the car serves as one view among several and provides the user with information about the car’s activities. LibViz, our second prototype, is based on a full screen 3D representation of a library building. Measured data is visualised in overlaid, semi-transparent windows to allow the user interpretation of the data in its spatial context of the library’s 3D model. Based on the two prototypes, we identify the benefits and drawbacks of the approach, investigate aspects of coordination between the 3D model and the abstract visualisations, and discuss principals for a general approach.</div>
